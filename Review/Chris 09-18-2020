I started selling on eBay a little over a month ago, rare books mainly. Two nights ago an eBay customer bought some deluxe editions that were costly. What does ****** do? They limit my account to where I can not touch my money - demand intrusive information, like my state drivers license - even though my account is verified through my bank. On top of this, they will not respond to messages in their so-called "Help Center" and won't respond to phone calls, just leaving you waiting and waiting for a representative no matter when or how many times you call. I contacted eBay and they even released every hold on my order payments, noting how good a job I have done, with no negative feedback and returning eBay customers. ****** can be sued, and this may be the route I have to take (and maybe you yourself) if they keep ignoring me and not allowing me to access my own money! This is a warning to all of you would be on-line sellers - beware of ****** and how they will limit your account if you all the sudden have several sales or anything they deem "suspicious". They state it'll be 5 business days while they review your account. Look at ******'s average rating here on the BBB, one star - that's for a reason. ****** has no respect for their customers and show it blatantly. Be warned!
